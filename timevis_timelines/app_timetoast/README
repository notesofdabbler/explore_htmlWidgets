# A Shiny App with Timelines using timevis

I am using two examples of timeslines from [timetoast](https://www.timetoast.com/) site and recreating them using [timevis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/timevis/index.html). The demo of the app is [here](https://notesofdabbler.shinyapps.io/app_timetoast/).
